KEY DESCRIPTION FROM DATA GOTTEN USING POSTGRESQL: 
The analysis provides insights into factors influencing crop yield. 
The rainfall distribution shows most crops receive moderate rainfall, with higher yields between 1,100â€“1,999 mm, but very high rainfall (above 2,000 mm) leads to lower yields.
On average, crop yields are 328.1 units, with a wide range from 46 to 628. Correlation analysis suggests that farm size strongly influences yield (0.989 correlation), while rainfall, soil quality, sunlight, and fertilizer have weaker or negligible effects.
Soil analysis reveals that yield improves with better soil quality but drops slightly at the highest levels. Farms categorized as large produce the highest yields, averaging 495 units, while small farms yield the least (161 units). 
Larger farms also tend to use more resources like fertilizer and benefit from moderate soil quality and rainfall. Overall, improving farm size and soil management appears crucial for boosting yields.
